[HackBio](https://thehackbio.com/) is a virtually regimented research internship that is practice oriented and focused on equipping African scientists with advanced bioinformatics and computational biology skills. By the end of internship, successful interns should have:
- Honed their skills in a specific bioinformatics method
- Have at least a peer-reviewed article to show for the internship experience

1. Importing data (From Galaxy Library)
2. Checking data quality using FastQC
3. Mapping reads to a reference using BWA-MEM
4. Post-processing mapped reads:
      - Merge datasets using SAMFiles
      - Remove duplicates using MarkDuplicates
      - Left aligning indels using BAM left align
      - Filtering reads 
5. Calling non-diploid variants using FreeBayes
6. Filtering variants using VCFfilter
7. Visualization using IGV
8. Compare frequencies



# Calling variants in non-diploid systems
#### _By: AvatarAnton Nekrutenko AvatarAlex Ostrovsky_

## Questions
How does frequency of mitochondrial polymorphisms change from mother to child?

## Objectives
Using Galaxyâ€™s main site we will see how to call variants in bacteria, viruses, and organelles.

## Requirements
1. Introduction to Galaxy Analyses
2. Sequence analysis
      - Quality Control
      - Mapping
