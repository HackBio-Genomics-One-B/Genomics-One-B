[HackBio](https://thehackbio.com/) is a virtually regimented research internship that is practice oriented and focused on equipping African scientists with advanced bioinformatics and computational biology skills. By the end of internship, successful interns should have:
- Honed their skills in a specific bioinformatics method
- Have at least a peer-reviewed article to show for the internship experience

# Calling variants in non-diploid systems 
By: Anton Nekrutenko and Alex Ostrovsky


## Introduction
A handful of life ranging from prokaryotes, down to viruses and a few extension operate on non-diploid mechanism.
In this tutorial Team Genomics_One_B will be recreating the above project which involves working on four datasets, gotten from human genomic DNA sequencing. The aim of this is to identify heteroplasmies variant within the mitochondria DNA using Galaxy packages.



The raw reads were downloaded from [here](https://zenodo.org/record/1251112)

https://zenodo.org/record/1251112/files/raw_child-ds-1.fq
https://zenodo.org/record/1251112/files/raw_child-ds-2.fq
https://zenodo.org/record/1251112/files/raw_mother-ds-1.fq
https://zenodo.org/record/1251112/files/raw_mother-ds-2.fq

In this tutorial, we will cover:


## STEP 1: IMPORTING DATASET

- Download datasets from resource page
- Click upload data on Galaxy web page
- Galaxy will prompt to ask if it is from the local files or web (it depends on where you saved the dataset)
- After uploading, click start. Once import is completed, the dataset highlight turns green as seen on the picture below.

## STEP 2: QUALITY CHECK OF DATASET

It is important to check the quality of the data to be used before proceeding with the analysis. This is done to determine if there is a problem with the dataset. Click on  FASTA/Fastq on the left hand side, select 'FastQC Read Quality Check' and execute. It will run a check on the data.

## STEP 3: MAPPING THE READS USING BWA MEM 

Human genome, ‘hg38’ was used as the reference genome.Using the Paired end sequencing, the datasets has to be uploaded by selecting multiple datasets as follows:

- First set of reads: both dataset 1 `raw_child-ds-1.fq` & `raw_mother-ds-1.fq `
- Second set of reads: both datasets 2 `raw_child-ds-2.fq` & `raw_mother-ds-2.fq`
Set read groups information to “Set read groups `SAM/BAM specification` and Execute
      
## STEP 4: POST-PROCESSING MAPPED READ

Step 4.1: 
- Merging `BAM` datasetsSelect Picard from the left side of the Galaxy page.
- Click Merge `SAM` Files tool, then import dataset obtained from Step 3 into the dataset collection.
- Input parameters as seen in the image below. Then execute Step 3

Step 4.2: Removing duplicates using MarkDuplicates
- Select Picard on the left side panel. 
- Click on `MarkDuplicates` In the `SAM/BAM` or dataset collection box. 
- Upload merged SAMFiles Input parameters as seen below and Execute

Step 4.3: Left-aligning indels using BamLeftAlign 
- ToolLeft aligning of indels is important for obtaining accurate variant calls (The BAM dataset generated by MarkDuplicates will be used to run this step)
- Click on Variant analysis and select BamLeftAlign
- Input MarkDuplicate dataset and use reference genome: hg38(Input parameters as seen in picture below)Execute

Step 4.4: 
- Filtering reads Select filter under BamToolsUsing MarkDuplicates dataset. 
- Input parameters as seen in picture below.
- Then execute (NB: Would you like to set rules should be NO)

## STEP 5: CALLING NON-DIPLOID VARIANTS USING FREEBAYES

You can navigate to the tool (FreeBayes) using the search button in Galaxy. Select the reference genome, mode of run and the BAM file input. Set the parameters for the following options (population mode, allelic scope, input filter) as seen in the images below.

## STEP 6: FILTERING VARIANTS USING VCF

Navigate to tool (VCFfilter) using the search button option on Galaxy Using the dataset obtained from step 5, Input parameters as seen in the image below and execute

## STEP 7: VISUALIZATION USING IGV

- Click on processed VCF datasets, it will expand to show link. 
- Click on “display at vcf.iobio” at the bottom
- Use the reference genome, Human hg38 for comparison
- VCF datasets will be index to display them
- Repeat process for IGV by clicking on "Display with IGV"
